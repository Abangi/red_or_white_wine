### Understanding the Problem

Our goal is to find what attributes it takes to make great wine  in order to maximize our efforts.

The following are the attributes of our dataset that we will be working with:

• Fixed acidity – level of acid found in the wine.

• Volatile acidity – the amount of acetic acid.

• Citric acid – can keep wine fresh for longer. Helps with shelf-life

• Residual sugar – how much sugar is present after fermentation is complete. This is what you think it is. Almost every wine will have some sugar present in it. In our dataset, you'll see that most have a low amount of around 1-3 grams/liter and very 
few have more than 25 grams/liter. Wines that have more than 30 grams/liter would be considered very sweet.

• Chlorides – how much salt is present.

• Free sulfur dioxide – used to prevent microbial growth.

• Total sulfur dioxide – high amounts create a noticeably bad taste in wine.

• Density – the density of the liquid.

• pH – how acidic the wine is.

• Sulphates – an additive in many wines to prevent unwanted microbial growth.

• Alcohol – the percentage of alcohol content found in the wine.

• Quality (target) – the wine was graded on a scoring metric from 0 (the worst) to 10 (excellent). This is based on various factors as determined by experts, but at a high 
level are things such as flavor, color, smell, and other subjective measures.
